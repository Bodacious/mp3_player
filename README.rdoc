=Mp3Player

Here's an mp3_player plugin for Rails.
Check out http://handyrailstips.com/tips/7-playing-mp3-s-on-your-rails-site-with-mp3_player for more info

To install:
	script/plugin install git://github.com/GavinM/mp3_player.git

To setup:
	rake mp3_player


This adds 'player.swf' to _public/_ and creates a new folder called _audio_ for storing all of your audio files.

Make sure all your audio files are stored in _public/audio_ or change the *AUDIO_PATH* constant in lib/mp3_player.rb


==Example Usage

To play an mp3 file called *mysong* _(public/audio/mysong.mp3)_ simply add <%= mp3_player("mysong") %> to your view.

You might find it easier to manage your files if you name them after the id of your model record.

Below is a list of the extra options you can specify:
(All colors should be expressed as hexadecimal values minus the '#'. eg. :bg => "99FFFF")

[:width] width of the player when open in pixels, defaults to 290
[:id] id of the div wrapping the player, defaults to "#{track_name}_player"
[:class] class of the div wrapping the player, defaults to "mp3_player"
[:bg] background colour, defaults to "BBBBBB"
[:left_bg] background colour of the left tab, defaults to "AAAAAA"
[:right_bg] background colour of the right tab, defaults to "AAAAAA"
[:right_bg_hover] colour of the right background as the cursor hovers over, defaults to "EEEEEE"
[:left_icon] the colour of the speaker icon on the left, defaults to "222222"
[:right_icon] colour of the play/pause icon on the right, defaults to "222222"
[:right_icon_hover] colour of the play/pause icon as the cursor hovers over, defaults to "222222"
[:text] colour of the text, defaults to "222222"
[:slider] colour of the slider bar, defaults to "333333"
