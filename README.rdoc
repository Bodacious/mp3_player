=Mp3Player

Here's an mp3_player plugin for Rails.
Check out http://handyrailstips.com/tips/7-playing-mp3-s-on-your-rails-site-with-mp3_player for more info

To install:
	script/plugin install git://github.com/GavinM/mp3_player.git

To setup:
	script/generate mp3_player [name of your mp3 directory]

This adds 'player.swf' to <em>public/</em> and creates a new folder for storing all of your audio files.

==Example Usage

To play an mp3 file found in _public/mp3s/mysong.mp3_ simply add <%= mp3_player("mp3s/mysong.mp3") %> to your view.

If you're using paperclip: 
	<%= mp3_player @my_model.mp3.url %>.
